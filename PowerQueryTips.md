# Data Journey Notes: Thoughts on Trust, Talk, and Tools

Hellooo there! Grab a cup of coffee, settle in, and let's chat about some data tips, shall we? 
Whether you're a total noob or you've been around the block a few times, these little nuggets of wisdom should help you out! 
And yeah, there's no particular order hereâ€”just a bunch of good stuff I've learned along the way. Let's dive in!

## Trust, but VERIFY!!
Ohhh, the joys of data tools like Power Query, Excel, Pythonâ€¦ ðŸ™„ Just because something works in one tool doesn't mean it's gonna play nice in another. 
So, here's what I do: always test a sample of your data transformations. As you get more comfy with the tools, youâ€™ll get a sense of how they behave. 
BUT, if you're just starting out or trying something newâ€”seriously, make sure it works. This doesnâ€™t just apply to tools, itâ€™s a PEOPLE thing too! 
Youâ€™ll hear business folks (a.k.a. stakeholders) swear that "the program logic makes sure nothing funky happens with the data." Ahem. WRONG. 
I canâ€™t tell you how many times I've checked something, found a problem, and they go, "Oh yeah, I forgot about that scenario..." ðŸ˜’

## Communication!!!
Okay, if you're an introvertâ€¦ sorry, but NOT SORRY. You're gonna have to get comfortable talkingâ€”like, to a LOT of people. Business stakeholders, data analysts, supervisors, VPs... you name it. 
And guess what? They all have different styles. PLUS, depending on where you work, your access to data will vary. Like, I've had positiones where I could dive right into the database, 
but then I had NO clue how the thing was designed, so half the columns made no sense. Other times, I needed people to pull data for me. 
Soooo, being good at building friendly work relationships? IT'S A LIFESAVER. 
Trust me, you want folks on your side when you need data or have to whip up an "ad hoc" analysis (cue the eyerollâ€”because you'll learn fast that every "ad hoc" report is a so-called "priority"â€¦ 
until you finish it and no one ever looks at it again. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¥¹

## Learn What You're Allowed to Work On!
By this, I mean both the data itself and the tools you're using. Understanding the boundaries of your role, the tools at your disposal, and the data you can access is essential. 
Right from the get-go, figure out how you can access data. Ideally, you'd want direct access to the database (makes life so much easier). If not, know who to ask for the data. 
Cue advice #2â€”being good at chatting people up is KEY. And when it comes to toolsâ€¦ oh man, I had a manager who flat-out REFUSED to let me use Python! So, guess what? I had to become BFFs with Power Query and Excel. 
SOOOOO yeah, roll with the punches and adapt!

There ya have it! Just a few tips to keep in your back pocket. Hope this helps, and may the data gods be ever in your favor! ðŸ˜œ
